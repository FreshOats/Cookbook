SELECT recipe FROM websites WHERE blog IS NULL
There is nothing more infuriating than trying to prepare food from a promising link with a mouth-watering tag of metadata leading you into a chasm of adverts, pop-ups, and, of course, someone's life story about how their shoe size was too small, and while trying to remove the shoe, they banged their head on a pickle jar, and the brine in their hair induced the inception of their California-Georgia Fusion Gluten Free Air-Fried Green Tomatoes with Cashew-Quinoa-Chia Relish.
After jokingly writing that ridiculous title, I'm actually intrigued to try making it now… though I would definitely not use an air fryer; I'll stick to cast iron. For now, we're going to start with Ancho Fish Tacos paired with a Cadillac Margarita!
The Recipe: 
SELECT DISTINCT(Ingredient), MAX(Quantity), MAX(Units)
FROM Ingredients
WHERE Recipe = 'Ancho Fish Tacos'
GROUP BY Ingredient
ORDER BY Ingredient;

SELECT Step_Number, Instruction
FROM Steps
WHERE Recipe = 'Ancho Fish Tacos'
ORDER BY Step_Number;
The Queries for the Cadillac Margarita are the same as the tacos, only changing the WHERE clause.

Considerations
So just a few simple things we may want to do before placing a grocery-pickup order or, cringe, heading to the grocery store: 
Query the ingredients needed to make the meal, ignoring the drink pairing. It's important to see the potential substitutes and which ingredients can't be substituted, just in case a key ingredient isn't available.

--Query the ingredients needed to make the meal, ignoring the drink pairing
SELECT DISTINCT(I.Ingredient), I.Substitutes
FROM Ingredients I
  INNER JOIN 
  Recipes R ON R.Recipe_name = I.Recipe
WHERE R.Drink_Pairing IS NOT NULL; -- Only Drink Recipes have a NULL drink pairing
Scale up for additional guests, anticipating they may want drinks. The following code block provides 8 people with food and 2 drinks each. Since each recipe provides a different number of servings, I'm using a UNION statement to deliver the totals from each recipe. 

SELECT Recipe_name, Servings 
FROM Recipes; 
-- The Ancho Fish Tacos recipe makes 2 servings
-- The Drink Recipe makes a single drink

SELECT Ingredient, MAX(Quantity)*4 AS Total_Needed, MAX(Units) AS Units
FROM Ingredients
WHERE Recipe = 'Ancho Fish Tacos'
GROUP BY Ingredient
  UNION
SELECT Ingredient, MAX(Quantity)*16 AS Total_Needed, MAX(Units) AS Units
FROM Ingredients
WHERE Recipe = 'Cadillac Margarita'
GROUP BY Ingredient
ORDER BY Ingredient;
Total quantites needed for the shopping list. Limes appear twice as they are in both the drink and taco recipe, this is a limitation of the current query. Additionally, conversions from tsp and tbsp would make this more shopper-friendly. This will be an update in a future query. Finally, as the organized kitchen chaos begins, it is useful to know at which steps the ingredients will be needed, which can be determined executing the following query:

SELECT S.Step_Number, I.Ingredient, S.Instruction
FROM Steps S
  INNER JOIN 
  Ingredients I ON S.Recipe = I.Recipe
      AND S.Step_number = I.Step_number
WHERE S.Recipe = 'Ancho Fish Tacos';
Red Wine Vinegar is needed twice, which isn't obvious if you start cooking before fully reading the instructions, which no one has ever done in the history of cooking… 

If you've made it this far, awesome! For more recipes and drink pairings, check in soon! And I'm serious about the California-Georgia Fusion Gluten Free Fried Green Tomatoes. </Nonsense>
